Do not plug in numbers.\nAssess your answer. Check units and use some logical reasoning to defend your answer (or explain why it’s wrong). Some methods you could use for the reasoning includes making predictions and seeing if your result matches those predictions, relating the answer to something you know (e.g. plugging in specific numbers and checking if they match real-world scenarios), and evaluating the equation (check limits and special cases, make sure it does what you expect)\n\n\n\nPhysics Concepts\n\nKinematicsForcesCollisions and InteractionsEnergyRotation\n\n\nPosition, velocity, and acceleration and the time derivatives/integrals that relate them\nSpecial types of kinematics:\n\nExpressing position, velocity, and acceleration in polar coordinates\nConstant speed, fixed length, and constant acceleration motion\nOscillations and periodic motion\n\n\n\nNewton’s first law and inertial frames\nNewton’s second law and relating forces to motion\nNewton’s third law and force-related interactions between objects\nIn addition, we have seen the following forces:\n\nGravity (on a planet)\nUniversal Gravitation (Gravity in space)\nTension\nPush and pull forces\nNormal force\nStatic friction (three cases: definitely not moving, maybe going to move, on the verge of moving)\nKinetic friction\nVelocity-dependent forces (drag, etc)\nSpring force\n\n\n\nImpulse and change in momentum\nConservation of linear momentum\nCollisions\n\nElastic\nInelastic\nPerfectly inelastic (stick together)\nExplosion (reverse perfectly inelastic)\n\n\n\nWork and kinetic energy\nWork done by conservative v. nonconservative forces\nPotential energy\nConservation of mechanical energy\n\n\nAngular momentum of a particle\nAngular momentum of an extended object\nTorque and Newton’s 2nd Law for Rotation\nRotational kinetic energy\nConservation of angular momentum\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Euler-Lagrange Equations\nThe Euler–Lagrange equations help us find how a system moves. They come from the idea that nature chooses the path that makes the “action” (a quantity built from kinetic and potential energy) as small as possible. Instead of focusing directly on forces, these equations let us work with energy and generalized coordinates, which often makes solving problems—especially with constraints—much simpler.\nAll the equations we will use this semester arise from the Euler-Lagrange equations, from energy conservation to Newton’s second law to conservation of momentum.\nTo use them, you have to construct the Lagrangian (L = T -V), determine the proper coordinates to use (i.e. what coordinates will you use to describe your problem and your solution?), and then plug them into the Euler-Lagrange equation, which involves taking derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to the coordinates you’ve chosen.

You must get at least 70% of the points on the PCQs to pass the class.\n\n\nEverything except PCQs will be graded on the following scale:\n\nE: exceeds expectations – this is a thorough and correct answer that demonstrates excellent understanding of the concepts and makes proper use of the mathematical skills expected in this class.\nM: meets expectations – this is an answer that demonstrates solid understanding of the concepts but perhaps includes some small mathematical errors or minor conceptual mistakes.\nR: revise or retake – this is an answer that applies the concepts incorrectly, misunderstands the point of the question, does not complete the question, fails to follow directions, and/or contains significant mathematical errors\nN: not assessable – if you turn nothing in, you will receive an N. You will also receive an N if your work is illegible, too minimal to assess, or irrelevant.\n\nE and M are considered passing grades. To get an A or B in this class, you must achieve some Es (see the grading scheme)\nR and N are considered failing grades. Only Rs can be revised or retaken.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading bundles\n\nPCQsWHWsGroup unit summariesUnit testsCommunity engagementWild Card: Problem Project\n\n\nIn order to get the most out of class, you need to prepare. To do this, most days we will have a pre-class quiz due in Lyceum, which you must complete prior to class start. These are graded on points, and you only need to achieve an average of 70%.\nGiven the purpose of the PCQs, I will not offer extensions, except in case of a major medical or family emergency that causes you to miss class.\n\n\nRegular problem-solving is very important to developing confidence and skill in this content, so every week you will have a weekly problem set. You will turn in the weekly problem set by scanning and uploading as a PDF to Moodle. These are due by 8PM each Wednesday.\nThese are graded on an EMRN scale, and you can revise any homework that receives an R grade once. You may not revise the same homework twice, and E, M, and N grades cannot be revised.\nYou may work with classmates on the homework, but please be sure to give credit.\nYou may request extensions on the WHWs using the extension form.\n\n\nThis assignment is meant to help you organize what you’ve learned, reinforce problem-solving strategies, and create a resource you can use for studying later.\nAt the end of each module, your team will create a Unit Summary that captures the key ideas from the unit. The goal is to build a concise but useful reference that highlights what you’ve learned and how to apply it.\nYour Unit Summary should include:\n\nKey concepts, definitions, and constants\nRelevant equations for each concept\nProblem-solving tools and strategies\nOne example problem from the homework for each key concept from the unit (you may illustrate up to two concepts in the same problem)\n\nShow the worked-out solution clearly enough that a future student could follow your reasoning.\n\nEnd-of-unit summary: a short (1–2 paragraph) summary highlighting the most important ideas of the unit, why they matter, and how to approach problems that involve those concepts.\n\nEach unit summary is graded on an E/M/R/N scale, and an E and M are both considered passing grades. Your team may revise a unit summary that receives an R grade one time.\nYour team may request an extension on the unit summary using the extension form. Only one member of the team needs to submit the extension request.\n\n\nThere will be three unit tests during class throughout this semester. The tests are cumulative, but they will largely focus on the more recent material. These tests will occur in class, and you may bring a single-sided 8.5”x11” sheet of paper with equations and notes - hand-written (please speak to me if you need to type the sheet and we will come up with a plan). This paper will be turned in with your test.\nThese are graded on an E/M/R/N scale, and you may retake each unit test during the scheduled make-up test days. In order to retake a unit test, you must first correct your first unit test and complete a short reflection in a Google form.\n\n\nAt the end of each module, you and your peers will fill out a form where you provide feedback on your teammates’ contributions and your own. Your self-assessment and your peers’ assessments will be weighted equally in the grade, and I will also take into account your participation in pre-class quizzes and your in-class attendance in order to determine a final grade for each module.\nThese are graded on an E/M/N scale. Not submitting your own form will result in an “N” regardless of how your team rates your participation. Note that you cannot revise or retake community engagement.\nI recognize that group work and peer grading can be fraught. I have been in many difficult group projects myself, and as a queer woman in physics, I’m not unaware of cultural and social biases that exist in our field. If there are any concerning dynamics in your group, I hope that you feel safe talking to me in addition to including that information in your feedback form. You may also fill out my anonymous feedback form and give me only the information you think I need to address this issue anonymously.\n\n\nThe student becomes the teacher… you will have an opportunity to write a physics problem similar to your homework problems. You must:\n\nselect at least one concept each from three different concept groups\nselect one mathematical tool to highlight\nwrite a physics problem that tests understanding of those concepts and uses the math tool\nwrite up a detailed solution to that problem using the four-step problem solving method\nexplain how your problem tests understanding for the concepts you selected\n\nThese are graded on an E/M/R/N scale, and you may use each problem project score to replace one of the following:\n\nyour PCQ score for the semester (an M or higher gives you full credit on the PCQs)\ntwo (2) WHW scores\none (1) unit test score\none (1) unit summary score\none (1) community engagement grade\n\nI will always replace the grade item that most benefits you, and will never replace a better score with a worse one. The Problem Project can only help you.\nYou may request extensions on the problem projects using the extension form. Please note, however, that the final problem project cannot be extended beyond the end of final exam period.\nPlease note that the Problem Project cannot be revised, given the time constraints. I am always happy to talk through drafts in office hours before you turn it in.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading boosts\n\nCommunity BuilderTime ManagementTest CrusherGrowth Boost\n\n\nIf you receive all Es on your community engagement, I will round your grade up.\n\n\nIf you use no more than 3 extension requests all semester (on individual assignments), I will round your grade up.\n\n\nIf you get Es on every unit test, I will round your grade up.\n\n\nIf you demonstrate consistent improvement in your work across the semester, I reserve the right to round your grade up.",

Please feel free to reach out to me directly if you are struggling to meet a deadline. I want to support you and make sure you have the best possible chance for success in this class, and the only way I can help is if you communicate with me.\nIn general, I am happy to be flexible. Please note, however, that some assignments will have stricter deadlines. These assignments include the PCQs and the final portfolio and final problem project, and the nature of the deadlines is discussed in their descriptions above.",

    "text": "Team-Based Learning\nI am using a variation of team-based learning for this class, in order to cultivate a community-minded classroom, encourage a growth mindset, and build group work skills. Here is how this will work:\nWe will have three modules, and you will work in a team of 4-6 students for each module. Your team will work on problems in class, discuss the content, and do regular short presentations to the class. At the end of each module, your team will assemble a unit summary to turn in, and you will provide feedback on your teammates and on your own work. These are the two graded portions related to team-based work. After each module, we will shuffle the groups, so you will have three different teams over the course of the semester.\nIn order to be a good member of your team, there will be a reading quiz (the PCQ) that must be completed prior to class. You must complete at least 70% of these PCQs to pass the class.\nNot all of the work will be in groups. You will also have individual tests and homework. You can work with other students on your homework, but the final work you submit must be your own.\nI have tried to balance the class so that there is a mix of individual and group work, which I hope will allow everyone to get something meaningful out of the course.",
