Specifically, read this article about how LLMs actually work and this article about the ethical considerations around LLMs\nThat you consider ChatGPT - or any other LLM -a source that you must cite. If you an LLM to help with any assignment, you must acknowledge that help and give a short (one-sentence) description of what the LLM did for you and how it helped you solve the problem.\n\nRemember that LLMs are designed to predict the most probable response to a question, which is not always the best or even correct response. They are prone to “hallucinating” (making stuff up, often in a way that is convincing but still false). They can’t do creative problem solving, which is the most important skill we are teaching in this class.",

Their role is to support students seeking help with time management, organization, reading, test-taking, note-taking, and other academic skills.
